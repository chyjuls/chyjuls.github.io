                My full name is Chinyere Ugorji, but friends and colleagues know me as Chichi.<br>
                I currently work within the healthcare sector but have a passion for all things technology,
                which influenced, to a large extent, my decision to pursue a course in Diagnostic radiography.<br>
                At that time I was interested in patient care as well as technology and sought to intergrate both.<br>
                Currently, my passion for technology has however outweighed my love for healthcare,
                although I know based on current projections, that there is a place for technology in medicine and healthcare.<br>
                I have done some personal learning in  different aspects of information technology,although I felt overwhelmed initially,I have choosen to pursue a career in Software developement.

    I am also interested in cybersecurity and have some certifications in Network Security(ComptiA).<br>
    During the current the lockdown in 2020, I signed up to the cybersecurity program, with Techtalent
    where, I left some coding languages and cybersecurity fundamentals. <br>
    My exposure to coding using a few programming languages piqued my interest further in software development.
    Languages learnt during this period include Python; C++; Java; JavaScript and HTML/CSS(not really langauges).
    <br> You can view some of the projects I have worked on here:

I trained as  a radiographer(completed my training in 2005), and have been practicing since then.
I however specialised as an MRI radiogrpaher, and currently practicing with my professional qualification.<br>
In previous years I have done plain radiography, Computed radiography and MRI radiography.I have also worked as a research radiographer
having published an article in one of the international journals, this was for my Master's dissertation.<br>
I have always had an interest in information technology and so, did a few professional courses in project management and business analysis in order to manage IT projects within
the hospital. I did this for 24 months while retaining my clinical skills.
My coding journey is therefore one which I hope will lead to a career change to software development/cybersecurity, well of course, I think 
starting with software development is the way to go, with the view to learn more about securing web and mobile applications.

    <h2 class ="article-subtitle"> What next...</h2>
    <p class = "subtitle-text">

I am in search of opportunities as a junior software developer, so I can put all I have learnt
and continue to learn to use. I enjoy coding so much,  that it has indeed become a hobby.
While waiting for an opportunity, I keep myself busy by building mini projects and expanding my  knowledge of the coding languages, 
I have learnt so far. Suffice to say, that my favourite languages are Python, Java and C++ in that order.<br>
